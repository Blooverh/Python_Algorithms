> *Stack* is a collection of objects that is inserted and removed according to LIFO (last in first out) like a stack of plates. Stacks are the simplest of all data structures yet among the most used and important.

> *STACK* is an ADT (abstract data type)

> As a consequence of the LIFO protocol, a stack can be used as a general tool to reverse a data sequence.
